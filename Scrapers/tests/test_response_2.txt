It will evaluate the most applicable functional measures for closed-loop feedback for\nbioelectronic management of gastric disorders, including gastroparesis, reflux disease, and eating disorders.","spending_categories_desc":"Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","awd_doc_num":"OOD023847A","init_encumbrance_date":"2016-09-24T04:00:00Z","can_task":["2016.100"],"special_topic_code":null,"agency_code":"NIH","covid_response":null}]}
